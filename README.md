# Data-Structures-Lab
Slicing and dicing till I get something working for class.
So many videos, github scans, google searches on for loops and the bits and bobs for the min max largest and smallest numbers list to work.
searched documentation and some code didn't jive so I switched the make and model.
need to go back over and adding a few pages to flesh this out.

Hilarity ensues in the nostalgia ridden game of Loopy Labs.

Learning the ins and outs of loops and hash maps in Java.

May contain fruit loops and good laughs.

Learned alot through continous testing and breaking today.

I also learned that you can write in another language in intelliJ.

I learned how to structure, booleans, for/while loops, try/catch, if/else, switch cases, & private static voids.
